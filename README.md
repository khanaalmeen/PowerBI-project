## 3. Crytocurrency 
I worked on a Cryptocurrency Project which  I downloaded the dataset from Kaggle and analyzed top seven cryptocurrencies.



I created a two-page interconnected dashboard visualizing the trends and patterns of these coins for the past nine years. This includes the prices of these coins and how they have changed overtime.



I also used power BI built-in predictive forecasting model to forecast the future market trends of these coins based on 90% confidence values within the next 12 months.
